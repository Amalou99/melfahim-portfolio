Passionate software engineer with a strong background in programming languages like Java. interested in DevOps technologies like Docker, Jenkins and Kafka.

Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at kShuttle where I am helping to build tracking the commitments solution of BPI France's clients.

I'm very dedicated to learn new things and firmly believe that learning should never cease. I enjoy creating different things by writing technical articles.

When I am not coding you can find me playing football (Visca Barca and MESSI is the best ever), having fun with friends or listing some Tamazight music (Rouicha is the Best).
